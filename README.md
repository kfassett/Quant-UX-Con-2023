Title: 
QuantUXR to QuantCritUXR: Strategies for Centering Underrepresented Individuals in Research

Abstract:
Historically, quantitative research emerged from positivistic perspective, where individuals applying the methods searched for one truth, or answer, to a question. However, critical paradigms (e.g., feminist theory, queer theory, critical race theory) challenged this approach by acknowledging past lenses used to design, analyze, and interpret research may be biased due to underlying social phenomena. To aide in better implementing quantitative methods, researchers more recently began using an inquiry termed “QuantCrit” to conduct research, highlighting differences in individuals’ lived experiences more thoughtfully. Given an increasing emphasis on, and need to explore, DEI in industry, this session focuses on QuantCrit practices and ways they might support product inclusion goals as well as build on Quant UXR skills.

QuantCrit acknowledges and entails: 1. Racial biases are pervasive and often not captured in the quantification of users’ experiences, 2. Data frequently possess biases due to comparisons based on identities, 3. Categories assigned to numerical data function simplistically, overlooking complex user experiences, 4. Data alone cannot provide the depth of an individual user experience thus research should be informed alongside users, particularly those from underrepresented groups, and 5. Statistical analyses both enhance and detract from the goal of creating more equitable products. 

Taking the five components of QuantCrit into consideration, we will explain what this inquiry process entails in comparison to traditional quantitative methods, share implementation strategies through several examples (e.g., strategies for collecting demographic information, coding alternatives in R), and invite a conversation about how QuantCrit might further amplify Quant UXR work.
